# ðŸ§ª Testing

There are unit testing done with [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com) and [`jest`](https://jestjs.io), and end to end tests done with [`cypress`](https://cypress.io).

* Unit tests are located in the folder: `__tests___`
* E2E tests are located in the folder: `cypress`

We test component in isolation with `testing-library` and the complete application with `cypress`.

Note that to run `cypress` scenarios, you'll need to start:

* docker image
* frontend app
* cypress

What we test:

* That information are displayed correctly
* Switching agency update the user inface
* Clicking on a message open the details pane
* The unread count correctly updates
* URLs matchs the application's state

There could be an integration test for the `<Layout />` component.
